Notes
=====
Occasionally you may get a forecast icon of NA. This means the conversion of the forecast text is failing. Please raise an issue and paste the forecast text at the time and it should be a simple fix.

The data in FullMoons.csv was created with information from https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/phases, it will need to be updated annually for accurate results, it is currently based on FullMoon dates only and extrapolates the various phases from there.
